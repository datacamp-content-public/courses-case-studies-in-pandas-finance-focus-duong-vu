Great job! You have made it nearly to the end of the course. There is only one thing I want to bring to your attention: comparing the two strategies that you have just learnt to compute.

Technical and fundamental analysis are two primary methods to analyze securities and make investment decisions. While fundamental analysis considers all the surrounding economic and financial factors that could affect the stock price, technical analysis believes that the market price already reflect those pieces of information, and only takes into account the price movement as well as volume to make prediction of the future price. Although there are many differences between these two approaches, it is important to understand the distinction in order to make the most of your investment decisions.

## Differences between the two approaches

```yaml

`@part1`
**Fundamental analysis** {{1}}

- Input: Financial statements & ratios, industry trends, competitor's performance, and economic outlook. {{2}}

- Time horizon: Using a long term time frame because the data is generated in a wider time frame: financial statement (quarterly), change in company's executive(likely in more than a year). {{4}}

- Main Purpose: Investing {{6}}


`@part2`
**Technical analysis** {{1}}

- Input: Price and volume {{3}}

- Time horizon: Using short term data such as daily/weekly/monthly stock price, buy/sell volume {{5}}

- Main Purpose: Trading {{6}}

In here, I noted down some very basic differences between these two approaches: input, time horizon and main purpose. 

For input values, fundamental analysis takes in many factors such as financial statements & ratios, industry trends, competitor's performance, and economic outlook. Meanwhile, technical analysts only use 2 input values: price and volume. 

For time horizon, fundamental analysis is used for long term because its input data are generated in a wider time frame: financial statement by quarterly, change in company's executive would occurred in likely more than a year. On the other hand,  technical analysis uses short term data such as daily, weekly or monthly stock price, and buy and sell volume. 

Because of those differences, their main purpose are also slightly different. Fundamental approach has often been used for investing while technical approach are more helpful for trading.

If these sounds familiar for you, it's because they are both methods to seek profit from the stock market. Investors normally have a long term outlook and often hold stocks though the market's ups and downs. Traders on the other hand jump in and out of the stock market within minutes, days, or weeks with the purpose of making money immediately. 

Using one instead of the other or combining them is up to each individual investor/analyst but understanding them both will lead to the most informed decision. Fundamental analysis can give you an idea of the intrinsic or theoretical value of an asset, but technical analysis will help you determine when to act on that knowledge.

In the previous exercise, we learned to create some functions for computing technical indicators and in this exercise, we will apply one of those functions on the whole data frame and plot out the desired results as seen here.
